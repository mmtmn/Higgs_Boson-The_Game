This mobile game was developed in App Inventor 2 with the intent to promote scientific studies and enthusiasm around the scientific area among young humans, such as kids. 

This game however, can be played by experienced humans, such as the elderly one.  The game includes 10 levels and 1 easter egg. This is the first game I have ever made and I can rest assure you, that it served me well to fall in love even harder in the ocean of the programming world.
